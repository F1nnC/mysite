<h2 id="describing-my-project">Describing My Project</h2>

<ul>
  <li>My feature is has three main parts
    <ul>
      <li>Editor Table</li>
      <li>Calender</li>
      <li>Daily Taks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I have mostly finshed the frontend part of my feature, although in the future I would like to add a back button/delete button for the Calender</li>
  <li>This could be another button on the Editor Table or an X button on the tasks that delets it</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="video-plan">Video Plan</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I will show all features of my page
    <ul>
      <li>Type in the workout from the input</li>
      <li>Select A day</li>
      <li>Show that it pops up on the calender</li>
      <li>Add another workout but on the same day so it shows up on taks aswell</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Then I will show the code behind it and explain how it follows college board standords</li>
</ul>
