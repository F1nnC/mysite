<li>Collegeboard's grade and mine disagree in a few ways. I felt like mine was a little harder. whenever a description or code fragment is requested in an inquiry. I wouldn't notice anything when I looked at the question. The student may have clarified it elsewhere in their response, though. Additionally, I wasn't entirely sure where sequencing, selection, and iteration were located. I made an effort to find it, but I was forced to deduce it from the video.</li>
<li>The CPT needs to be quite intricate and capable of having a significant output input, function, and goal. It can't only be an information forum. It must have a function.</li>
