## Test Corrections

### Question 7
- I missread the question and mixed up the foxes and sheep role in the game. The sheep should have been reversed with goats, and foxes with sheep.

### Question 8
- I selected option A but not option D because I thought the sum of borrows and returns is a odd not postive. Although 1 book has 1 borrow and 1 return equaling a postive number

### Question 17
- The D option does the same thing as I did when I clicked option A. The outside result=false, is now inside the if stament, doing the same thing.

### Question 27
- The rotate_left and rotate_right action had to be done out side of the repeat n times.

### Question 28
- The A option also works because repeating all the actions 4 times will lead to the same result as C.

### Question 30
- I didn't select C, I selected B but i needed both. The parrameters of x=4, y=4, r=3, and instead of adding, they use subbtrating after drawing the circle.

### Question 37
- I must of missread the question when doing it in my mind, it is the same shape but just reflected. All that I had to do was follow the line but I must of messed up in my head.

## Reflection
- Most of my answers were because I didn't choose all possible peices of code on a multiple choice section, for example I would choose C, but It was suposed to be C and B
- The other answeres I got wrong were because of me doind something wrong in my head, or going to quick
