# EOY and N@TM plans

## EOY Project Plans

### Explaining Iteration
> Robot Game
- To explain iteration better to people who want to learn we will try to make a working version of the college board robot question
- It will make random questions
- That teach about looping, and recursion

- example problem
### Explain API
> Pizza Game
- We will simulate how AI works by making a Pizza Game
- Create = New Order, Delete = cancel an order, etc
- It will be easy to explain, its how real life pizza place software works
