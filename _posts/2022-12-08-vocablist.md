<h1 id="Vocab">Vocab<a class="anchor-link" href="#Vocab"> </a></h1><p>Procedure: is a named set of instructions that can take in parameters and return values.
May be called "method" or "function" in different programming languages.</p>
<p>Parameters: are independent variables used in the procedure to produce a result. It allows a procedure to execute without initially knowing specific input values.</p>
<p>Modularity: the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program</p>
<p>Abstraction: the practice of hiding the details of how a particular code or system works and exposing only the essential features or functions that are necessary for other parts of the program to use</p>
<p>Duplication: having multiple duplicate code blocks, often decreasing readability and efficiency</p>
<p>Logic: the sequence of steps and operations that a computer follows to execute a program, including the specific instructions and decision-making processes built into the code</p>
<p>Arguements: a way to provide information to a function, usually defined outside a function and then imported into a function with parameters</p>
<p>Iteration: a repeating portion of an algorithm, repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met</p>
<p>Iteration Statements: change the sequential flow of control by repeating a set of statements zero or more times, until a stopping condition is met</p>
<p>Repeat Until: if the condition evaluates to true initially, the loop body is not executed at all, due to the condition being checked before the loop</p>
<p>Complete Traversal: All elements in a list are assessed</p>
<p>Partial Traversal: Only a given portion of elements are assessed</p>
<p>Iterative Traversal: When loops are used to iterate through a list and to access each single element at a time.</p>
<p>Binary Search: repeatedly dividing a search interval in half</p>
<p>Agorithims: A set amount tasks to give an output</p>
