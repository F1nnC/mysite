## Q34
- My Answer: Show that for one instance of the problem, a heuristic is needed to write an algorithm that is capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer.

If it could be shown that an algorithm can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer for all other instances of this problem, then this problem would be decidable.
