## Notes
### 5.5
When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type.
There were many lawyers who made a profession out of patents
Qualcomm desires compensation for derivative work and requires a royalty payment for the use of ideas and patents.
Utilizing software under the GPL license could forfeit your ability to charge for the software and related patents.
The GPL open source license mandates that any work derived from the original must be free and the code must be shared.
The cost of using software under the GPL license might be greater than anticipated due to the loss of rights to charge for the software and patents.
Open source licenses such as the GPL have specific guidelines for sharing and distributing works derived from the original.
Companies like Qualcomm aim to be reimbursed for the usage of their patents and ideas, even within the realm of open source software.

### 5.6
Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is information that can be used to identify a person.
PII can be easily obtained through social media, online searches, and other online activities.
Be cautious of the information you share online, as it can be easily accessed by others.
Keep sensitive information such as financial credentials, two-factor authentication codes, and social security numbers private.
Multi-factor authentication and biometrics can increase the security of your systems.
Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption can also enhance the security of your systems.
Phishing and malware are potential threats that can compromise the security of your PII.
It is important to regularly review your PII vulnerabilities and take steps to protect your information.

## Hacks For 5.5
- There are multipble different licenses that give differing levels of permision, Creative Commons lets all your work be accesible and free for everyone, but for others like Open Source GPL will give less

- To summarize this, I think that everyone should stick by all rules in the world, but realisticly that won't happen, Not complying with licenses is alot like stealing a cookie from a cookie jar, your not supposed to have it, but there is little to no way that anyone will ever know you ate it.

## Hacks For 5.6

- I've seen PII inside my project, speficficly login/signup. It asked you for Username, Password, and All the other fitness related things in my project
- I think that you should handle your PII the same way that you handle it in person. Giving it to buiness that are trusted. 
- Good passwords should have more than 8 characters, atleast one symbol, and capitalized letter. A bad password would be a password with your easy to find personal info, EX: Birthday, Wifes Name. A step that is used in authentication
- Symtric only uses one key to decrypt or encrypt data, Asymtric does the same thing but has one public key and one private one
- The use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates, which encrypt communication between a user's browser and a website to prevent listening in and tampering, is one type of encryption utilized in an AWS deployment.
- Me personally I used to fall for free minecraft download when I was a kid. Some other phishing tech is making a user download a file that they think has something, but really has a virus. I think the OG method is the if you send me 1000 dollars Ill send you 10000 back prince story.
