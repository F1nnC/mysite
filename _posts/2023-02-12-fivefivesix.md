## Notes
### 5.5
The GitHub platform asks for the license type when you create a repository.
There were numerous attorneys who focused their careers on patents.
For the use of its ideas and patents, Qualcomm demands a royalty payment in addition to remuneration for derivative works.
You can lose the right to charge for the software and associated patents if you use software that is subject to the GPL license.
Any work that is generated from the original must be free, and the code must be shared, according to the GPL open source license.
Due to the loss of the ability to charge for the software and patents, the cost of utilizing GPL-licensed software may be higher than expected.
Specific standards for sharing and distributing works produced from open source licenses, such the GPL,

### 5.6
Information that can be used to identify an individual is known as personal identifiable information (PII). Social networking, online searches, and other online activities make it simple to gather PII. Take care while sharing information online because it can be easily viewed by others. Keep private sensitive data including social security numbers, two-factor authentication codes, and financial credentials. Biometrics and multi-factor authentication can both improve the security of your systems. The security of your systems can also be improved through symmetric and asymmetric encryption. Malware and phishing are two potential risks that could jeopardize the security of your PII. It's critical to regularly assess your PII vulnerabilities and take precautions to safeguard your data.

## Hacks For 5.5
- There are multipble different licenses that give differing levels of permision, Creative Commons lets all your work be accesible and free for everyone, but for others like Open Source GPL will give less

- To summarize this, I think that everyone should stick by all rules in the world, but realisticly that won't happen, Not complying with licenses is alot like stealing a cookie from a cookie jar, your not supposed to have it, but there is little to no way that anyone will ever know you ate it.

## Hacks For 5.6

- I've seen PII inside my project, speficficly login/signup. It asked you for Username, Password, and All the other fitness related things in my project
- I think that you should handle your PII the same way that you handle it in person. Giving it to buiness that are trusted. 
- Good passwords should have more than 8 characters, atleast one symbol, and capitalized letter. A bad password would be a password with your easy to find personal info, EX: Birthday, Wifes Name. A step that is used in authentication
- Symtric only uses one key to decrypt or encrypt data, Asymtric does the same thing but has one public key and one private one
- The use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates, which encrypt communication between a user's browser and a website to prevent listening in and tampering, is one type of encryption utilized in an AWS deployment.
- Me personally I used to fall for free minecraft download when I was a kid. Some other phishing tech is making a user download a file that they think has something, but really has a virus. I think the OG method is the if you send me 1000 dollars Ill send you 10000 back prince story.
