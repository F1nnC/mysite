## Notes
When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type.
There were many lawyers who made a profession out of patents
Qualcomm desires compensation for derivative work and requires a royalty payment for the use of ideas and patents.
Utilizing software under the GPL license could forfeit your ability to charge for the software and related patents.
The GPL open source license mandates that any work derived from the original must be free and the code must be shared.
The cost of using software under the GPL license might be greater than anticipated due to the loss of rights to charge for the software and patents.
Open source licenses such as the GPL have specific guidelines for sharing and distributing works derived from the original.
Companies like Qualcomm aim to be reimbursed for the usage of their patents and ideas, even within the realm of open source software.

## Hacks For 5.5
- There are multipble different licenses that give differing levels of permision, Creative Commons lets all your work be accesible and free for everyone, but for others like Open Source GPL will give less

- To summarize this, I think that everyone should stick by all rules in the world, but realisticly that won't happen, Not complying with licenses is alot like stealing a cookie from a cookie jar, your not supposed to have it, but there is little to no way that anyone will ever know you ate it.
