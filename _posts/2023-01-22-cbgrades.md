| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The program purpose was clearly stated, Everthing was cleary shown, and every input was given the right response |
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | List was named well, both code segments are provided but the second segment isn't acessing data from the list |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | Didn't mange complexity in the program, very easy to devolp |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 0 | Calls the rpsGame, although acording to college board was not specfic enough about how yourPlay effects the overall program |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Uses squencing selection and iteration with the rpsGame, Clearly explains the algorithm so it can be remade |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | The program calls two different functions and the text it gives back clearly shows the result. |
| Final | 4/6 | 3/6 | |
