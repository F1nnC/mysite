# Project Plan

| Rubric | Score | CBScore | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | My program has clearly labeled, has an input, output, and works |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | List was named well, I have two code segments, that collects data and shows the list in whater getID is picked |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The first part of the code manges complexity, and can be made using if staments instead of cases |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Calls the Add() and Tasks() is called inside the Add(), The Add() adds whatever text is given from the input and day, the tasks is called at the end of the Add() to check if the data that was added can also be added to the Daily Taks |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Uses squencing selection and iteration with the Add(), The algorthim can be made very easily and the code for it is shown below.
| Testing | 1 | 1 | The program calls two different functions and the text it gives back clearly shows the result. |
| Final | 6/6 | 6/6 | |

## Describing My Project

- My feature is has three main parts
    - Editor Table
    - Calender
    - Daily Taks

- I have mostly finshed the frontend part of my feature, although in the future I would like to add a back button/delete button for the Calender
- This could be another button on the Editor Table or an X button on the tasks that delets it

## Video Plan
- I will show all features of my page
    - Type in the workout from the input
    - Select A day
    - Show that it pops up on the calender
    - Add another workout but on the same day so it shows up on taks aswell
- Then I will show the code behind it and explain how it follows college board standords
