# 5.3/4 Notes/Hacks

## Intentional or Purposeful bias
---
### Google “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”? What does the data say? Is there purposeful exclusion in these platforms? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?
- Facebook tends to have a larger audience in older people because the platform is way easier to use than other ones
- Tiktok has most there audience in young audults/teens because most content on there is made for that demographic
- I dont think its that harmful
- It shouldn't be correct because most of the time, it is market toward that demographic, and they want that group of people
### Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. Was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?
- Virutal Voices have softer voices and the tone is nicer toward custmors
- Could be harmful because It could refornce sexist ideas that women can only be assistants
### Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple,Netflix, Google)
- The aglorithm that is choosed your decisions could be bais with the creators intent
- Unintenally making other people have your ideas

## Pair Questions
---
### Ideas
- Not made intentionally, It was made with only white people data, so it only recongizes white faces
- This could be another reason to end digital divide because if all people had acesses to computers problems like this wouldn't happen as often
- This should be corrected, not only is this a way to exlcude black people for something white people have (segration), from a buiness standpoint your losing a large demogrpahic
- Use data/faces in this scenario from people all around the world, so bias like this dont happen


### CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
- My feature is a nutrition feature. Some data I could collect is through crowdsourcing is asking the source or sample to look on the nutrition label on their lunches, and input some of the important values, such as calories.

### What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing?
- Getting data from everyone in Del Norte will make the application more fit for Del Norte. Actually, that is a good point about sampling: the more data collected from a population, the better fit the result is for the population (in the case of an application or PBL).

### What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week.
- I believe that the school food is not exactly the best food, and a lot of the choices the average high schooler makes regarding nutrition are not always the best. Therefore, data showing the nutritional data of Del Norte's food will most likely grab attention.
