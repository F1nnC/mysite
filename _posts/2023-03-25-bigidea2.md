## Q17
![Big Idea 2 Quiz Results](https://f1nnc.github.io/mysite/images/17.png)
- My Answer: The method of payment that was used in the greatest number of transactions during the 7-day period can be determined by sorting the data by the method of payment, then adding the number of items purchased for each type of payment method, and then finding the maximum sum.
- Correct Answer: The total number of items purchased on a given date can be determined by searching the data for all transactions that occurred on the given date and then adding the number of items purchased for each matching transaction.
- Reflection: Incorrect. This information can be determined using the data collected, but not the way described in this option. One way to determine the method of payment that was used in the greatest number of transactions during the 7-day period is to sort the data by the method of payment as described. Instead of adding the number of items purchased for each type of payment, a count of each payment type needs to be computed. If the counts are stored in a new field, then the counts can be sorted to find the method of payment used in the greatest number of transactions.

- My Answer: Sort by subject, then sort by year, then filter by photographer
- Correct Answer: Sort by year, then filter by year, then filter by photographer
- Reflection: Incorrect. This sequence of steps does not remove any entries with an unknown year, so the entry in the first row of the spreadsheet will have a year value of -1.
