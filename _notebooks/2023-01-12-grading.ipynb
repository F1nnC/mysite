    "I believe that overall, my score and the collegeboard's score were quite comparable. When I create my own assignment, I think it will be crucial to not only satisfy every requirement but also to have a little extra. This way, I will still have other lists that could cover this gap if collegeboard determines that one of my lists (for example) doesn't manage complexity. In addition, I believe I will need to be very specific in my writing and precise in my responses to the questions."
