For the use of its ideas and patents, Qualcomm demands a royalty payment in addition to remuneration for derivative works. You can lose the right to charge for the software and associated patents if you use software that is subject to the GPL license. Any work that is generated from the original must be free, and the code must be shared, according to the GPL open source license. Due to the loss of the ability to charge for the software and patents, the cost of utilizing GPL-licensed software may be higher than expected. Specific standards for sharing and distributing works produced from open source licenses, such the GPL, . 5.6 . Information that can be used to identify an individual is known as personal identifiable information (PII). Social networking, online searches, and other online activities make it simple to gather PII. Take care while sharing information online because it can be easily viewed by others. Keep private sensitive data including social security numbers, two-factor authentication codes, and financial credentials. Biometrics and multi-factor authentication can both improve the security of your systems. The security of your systems can also be improved through symmetric and asymmetric encryption. Malware and phishing are two potential risks that could jeopardize the security of your PII. It’s critical to regularly assess your PII vulnerabilities and take precautions to safeguard your data. . Hacks For 5.5 . There are multipble different licenses that give differing levels of permision, Creative Commons lets all your work be accesible and free for everyone, but for others like Open Source GPL will give less . | To summarize this, I think that everyone should stick by all rules in the world, but realisticly that won’t happen, Not complying with licenses is alot like stealing a cookie from a cookie jar, your not supposed to have it, but there is little to no way that anyone will ever know you ate it. . | My Blog License is here: Link, My Group Frontend and Backend are Linked On the review ticket . | . Hacks For 5.6 . I’ve seen PII inside my project, speficficly login/signup. It asked you for Username, Password, and All the other fitness related things in my project | I think that you should handle your PII the same way that you handle it in person. Giving it to buiness that are trusted. | Good passwords should have more than 8 characters, atleast one symbol, and capitalized letter. A bad password would be a password with your easy to find personal info, EX: Birthday, Wifes Name. A step that is used in authentication | Symtric only uses one key to decrypt or encrypt data, Asymtric does the same thing but has one public key and one private one | The use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates, which encrypt communication between a user’s browser and a website to prevent listening in and tampering, is one type of encryption utilized in an AWS deployment. | Me personally I used to fall for free minecraft download when I was a kid.

What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? . Getting data from everyone in Del Norte will make the application more fit for Del Norte.

What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. .

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

It meant my grade heavily depended on the final. Now I am in a situation where I might get a B if I didn’t meet the critera of the poject. | I will also make sure to pay more attention in class. I wasn’t paying as much attention as I shoud have during lectures | I need to work harder in class so I don’t have to do my projects on the weekends. | I have to also read more on the scheldule so I can do assignments correctly. | .",

As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language. The goal of the project is to make HTTP requests simpler and more human-friendly. &quot;&quot;&quot; import requests &quot;&quot;&quot; RapidAPI is the world&#39;s largest API Marketplace.

Formatting Digital Coin example . JSON text transferred from the API in the previous cell was converted to a Python Dictionary called json. The &quot;coins&quot; in the dictionary contain a list of the most relevant data. Look at the code and comments to see how the original text is turned into something understandable. Additionally, there are error check to make sure we are starting the code with the expectation that the API was run correctly. . &quot;&quot;&quot; This cell is dependent on valid run of API above. - try and except code is making sure &quot;json&quot; was properly run above - inside second try is code that is used to process Coin API data Note.

Hint: . write a “single” test describing an expectation of the program of the program | test - input burger, expect output of burger price | run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature | write “just enough” code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass | . Then repeat this process until you get program working like you want it to work. . menu = {&quot;burger&quot;: 3.99, &quot;fries&quot;: 1.99, &quot;drink&quot;: 0.99} total = 0 #shows the user the menu and prompts them to select an item print(&quot;Menu&quot;) for k,v in menu.items(): print(k + &quot; $&quot; + str(v)) #why does v have &quot;str&quot; in front of it? #ideally the code should prompt the user multiple times item = input(&quot;Please select an item from the menu&quot;) total = menu[item] #code should add the price of the menu items selected by the user print(total) .
