Uses PRAGMA statement to read schema. . Describe Schema, here is resource Resource- What is a database schema? . - It defines how the data is organized and how it can be accessed and modified by users and applications. . What is the purpose of identity Column in SQL database? It can be used as a primary key or as a reference in foreign keys to establish relationships between tables. | . | What is the purpose of a primary key in SQL database? It ensures that no two rows have the same values in the primary key column, and it can be used as a reference in foreign keys to establish relationships between tables. | . | What are the Data Types in SQL table?

            "content": ". Questions I got wrong . . Q2 . Question:Which of the following has the greatest potential for compromising a user’s personal privacy? | My Answer:The Internet Protocol (IP) address of the user’s computer | Correct Answer:A group of cookies stored by the user’s Web browser | Reflection: This option is incorrect. The IP address of a user’s computer is required for the user to send and receive information on the Internet. The IP address in itself does not contain any extra information about the user. | . . Q19 . Question:Which of the following best describes the contents of resultList after the code segment is executed? | My Answer:All elements in inputList1 followed by all elements in inputList2 | Correct Answer:Only elements that appear in both inputList1 and inputList2 | Reflection: This option is incorrect. The resultList contains only items from inputList1 that are also found in inputList2. | . . Q21 . Question:In order to test the program, the programmer initializes numList to [0, 1, 4, 5]. The program displays 10, and the programmer concludes that the program works as intended. | My Answer:The conclusion is incorrect; the program does not display the correct value for the test case [0, 1, 4, 5]. | Correct Answer:The conclusion is incorrect; using the test case [0, 1, 4, 5] is not sufficient to conclude the program is correct. | Reflection: This option is incorrect. The program does display the correct sum of 10 for the test case [0, 1, 4, 5]. | . . Q22 . Question:For which of the grids does the program correctly move the robot to the gray square? | My Answer:Neither grid I nor grid II | Correct Answer:Grid I only | Reflection: This option is incorrect. Although the program will not move the robot to the gray square in Grid II, it will correctly move the robot to the gray square in Grid I. | . . Q28 . Question: Which of the following code segments can be used to assign the intended string to newString ? | My Answer:newString ← substring(oldString, 3, len(oldString) - 2) | Correct Answer:tempString ← substring(oldString, 3, len(oldString) - 2) newString ← substring(tempString, 1, len(tempString) - 2) | Reflection: Incorrect. This code segment will remove only the first 2 characters of oldString. | . . Q29 . Question: What is displayed as a result of executing the code segment? | My Answer: true false true | Correct Answer: false false false | Reflection: Incorrect. The fourth statement assigns the value false to a. The fifth statement assigns the value false to c. | . . Q31 . Question: Which of the following algorithms can be used to open the gate under the appropriate conditions? | My Answer: Check if the time is outside of business hours. If it is, check if the gate sensor is activated. If it is, check if the gate is closed. If it is, turn on the motor. | Correct Answer: Check if the time is during business hours. If it is, check if the gate sensor is activated. If it is, check if the gate is open. If it is not, turn on the motor. | Reflection: Incorrect. This algorithm will turn on the motor in some cases when the time is outside business hours. | . . Q32 . Question: A certain game keeps track of the maximum and minimum scores obtained so far. If num represents the most recent score obtained, which of the following algorithms correctly updates the values of the maximum and the minimum? | My Answer: If num is greater than the minimum, set the minimum equal to num. Otherwise, if num is greater than the maximum, set the maximum equal to num. | Correct Answer: If num is less than the minimum, set the minimum equal to num. Otherwise, if num is greater than the maximum, set the maximum equal to num. | Reflection: Incorrect. The first check is incorrect. The minimum needs to be updated if the new number is less than the minimum, not greater. | . . Q33 . Question: Which of the following can be used as a replacement for MISSING STATEMENT so that the code segment works as intended? | My Answer: REPEAT 1 TIMES | Correct Answer: REPEAT 2 TIMES | Reflection: Incorrect. This code segment leaves the robot one row above its starting position and one row below the gray square. | . . Q38 . Question: Which of the following code segments is equivalent to the code segment above? | My Answer:IF(num &lt; 0) { DISPLAY(“negative”) } ELSE { DISPLAY(“positive”) } IF(num = 0) { DISPLAY(“zero”) } | Correct Answer: IF(num &lt; 0) { DISPLAY(“negative”) } ELSE { IF(num = 0) { DISPLAY(“zero”) } ELSE { DISPLAY(“positive”) } } | Reflection: Incorrect. The given code segment displays “positive” when num is positive, displays “negative” when num is negative, and displays “zero” when num is 0. This code segment does not produce the same result for all values of num. For example, “positive zero” is displayed when num is 0. | . . Q40 . Question: if any, should be made to the code segment to move the robot back to its original position in the bottom-left square of the grid and facing toward the bottom of the grid? | My Answer: Replace ROTATE_LEFT with ROTATE_RIGHT. | Correct Answer: No change is needed; the algorithm is correct as is. | Reflection: Incorrect. After moving forward two squares, turning right, and moving forward four squares, if the robot were to turn right, then the next move forward would put the robot into the black region of the grid. | . . Q45 . Question: Which of the following are benefits of procedural abstraction? | My Answer: Procedural abstraction prevents programmers from accidentally using the intellectual property of other programmers. | Correct Answer: Procedural abstraction provides an opportunity to give a name to a block of code that describes the purpose of the code block. | Reflection: Incorrect. Procedural abstraction does not prevent programmers from reusing code written by other programmers. | . . Q49 . Question: A city planner is using simulation software to study crowd flow out of a large arena after an event has ended. The arena is located in an urban city. Which of the following best describes a limitation of using a simulation for this purpose? | My Answer: Running a simulation requires more time to generate data from trials than observing the crowd exiting the arena at various events. | Correct Answer: The model used by the simulation software often omits details so that it is easier to implement. | Reflection: Incorrect. A simulation is often used when a real-world scenario is too impractical to test. A benefit of using a simulation is that it allows for rapid testing. | . . Q50 . Question: Based on the values in the table, which of the algorithms appear to run in reasonable time? | My Answer: Algorithm B | Correct Answer: Algorithm A | Reflection: Incorrect. As the size of the list grows, the number of steps needed to sort the list grows at an exponential rate, as the number of steps is equal to 2n for a list of size n . This indicates that the algorithm does not run in a reasonable amount of time. | .",

Titanic Data . Look at a sample of data. . import seaborn as sns # Load the titanic dataset titanic_data = sns.load_dataset(&#39;titanic&#39;) print(&quot;Titanic Data&quot;) print(titanic_data.columns) # titanic data set print(titanic_data[[&#39;survived&#39;,&#39;pclass&#39;, &#39;sex&#39;, &#39;age&#39;, &#39;sibsp&#39;, &#39;parch&#39;, &#39;class&#39;, &#39;fare&#39;, &#39;embark_town&#39;]]) # look at selected columns . Use Pandas to clean the data. Most analysis, like Machine Learning or even Pandas in general like data to be in standardized format. This is called &#39;Training&#39; or &#39;Cleaning&#39; data. . # Preprocess the data from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder td = titanic_data td.drop([&#39;alive&#39;, &#39;who&#39;, &#39;adult_male&#39;, &#39;class&#39;, &#39;embark_town&#39;, &#39;deck&#39;], axis=1, inplace=True) td.dropna(inplace=True) td[&#39;sex&#39;] = td[&#39;sex&#39;].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == &#39;male&#39; else 0) td[&#39;alone&#39;] = td[&#39;alone&#39;].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == True else 0) # Encode categorical variables enc = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown=&#39;ignore&#39;) enc.fit(td[[&#39;embarked&#39;]]) onehot = enc.transform(td[[&#39;embarked&#39;]]).toarray() cols = [&#39;embarked_&#39; + val for val in enc.categories_[0]] td[cols] = pd.DataFrame(onehot) td.drop([&#39;embarked&#39;], axis=1, inplace=True) td.dropna(inplace=True) print(td) . The result of &#39;Training&#39; data is making it easier to analyze or make conclusions. In looking at the Titanic, as you clean you would probably want to make assumptions on likely chance of survival. . This would involve analyzing various factors (such as age, gender, class, etc.) that may have affected a person&#39;s chances of survival, and using that information to make predictions about whether an individual would have survived or not. .

From Tutorials Point%20is,a%20consistence%20interface%20in%20Python). Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python.&gt; Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down.

Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | There was a good amount of complexity in the program, explains how the code can be written diffrently | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Uses list that has more list inside of it to mange complexity, also explains how the code can be written without lists | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Uses squencing selection and iteration with the rpsGame, Clearly explains the algorithm so it can be remade | . Testing | 0 | 0 | The result explains the code segements instead of giving the acual result, also doesn’t describe spefic arugments that are passed through the parameters | . Final | 5/6 | 5/6 |   | . . Reflection . I felt that my standords for grading and collegeboards are starting to become simalar. There was only one missed point that I didn’t get the same as college board and it was because I thought a program was described enough. I pretty much understand all 6 crietra now and what is needed for them. | My program in it current state has completed, Program and Purpose, Algorithm Impletation, and Testing. The reason for the others not being completed is because we still need to connect it fully to the backend. | Of the many reason that I’ve seen for a critera not being filled is the Data Abstraction catagory. The way I wont incounter this is by making sure I have to code segments, that mention each other, and are named well. |",

Algorithms are a finite set of instructions that accomplish a task. it has three parts, sequence, selection, and iteration | A sequence is the order of how to do something to achieve a result, similarly to how you follow the instructions from a teacher. | A selection allows an algorithm to make a decision based on if a condition is met, an example of this is when your car is out of fuel, you go to the gas station to fill your car, but if your car is full you wouldn&#39;t go to the gas station. | An iteration is a loop and doing something again until a condition is met, like you put away your computer when you are finished with your work. | Arithmetic uses addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and modulus operator | Addition: a+b | Subtraction: a-b | Multiplication: a*b | Division: a/b | Modulus: a MOD b | (a and b can be string or number) | A string concatenation connects two or more string end-to-end to make a new string | Len() gives the character number | strings are variables and can be joined together through the print() command to make a statement | .

Then repeat this process until you get program working like you want it to work. . menu = {&quot;burger&quot;: 3.99, &quot;fries&quot;: 1.99, &quot;drink&quot;: 0.99} total = 0 #shows the user the menu and prompts them to select an item print(&quot;Menu&quot;) for k,v in menu.items(): print(k + &quot; $&quot; + str(v)) #why does v have &quot;str&quot; in front of it? #ideally the code should prompt the user multiple times item = input(&quot;Please select an item from the menu&quot;) total = menu[item] #code should add the price of the menu items selected by the user print(total) .
