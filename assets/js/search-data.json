Information about which restaurants Brandon and Cynthia have visited in the past is not needed. Restaurants are recommended based on whether they can accommodate all allergies and dietary restrictions, not based on whether group members have been there before. Information about which food allergies and dietary restrictions can be accommodated at nearby restaurants is needed so that a restaurant can be recommended for the group. | . Question 12 . Incorrect. The name of a food item is input that needs to be provided by the customer in order for the order to be completed. | . Question 20 . Incorrect. Four bits can represent 24, or 16 pieces of information, so it is not necessary to add extra bits. | . Question 28 . Incorrect. This code incorrectly charges customers who use more than 25 units of electricity. These customers are charged $7 for each of the first 25 units and $5 for each subsequent unit. For examples, if a customer used 32 units of electricity, they should be charged $5 for the first 25 and $7 for the additional 7 units (32 – 25 = 7 units), for a total charge of $174. This code segment would incorrectly charge the customer 25 * $7 + 7 * $5 = $210 for the 32 units. | . Question 35 . Incorrect. This code segment sets maxPS to 50 by default, then uses the IF statement to set maxPS to 30 when time &gt; 120. | . Question 38 . Incorrect. While the list elements are strings, the indices of a list are typically nonnegative integers. | . Question 41 . Incorrect. This is the value of x after the code segment is executed, not the value of result. | . Question 43 . Incorrect. This is the value of x after the code segment is executed, not the value of result. | .",

Striver is a social media website that allows people to like posts that other users posted. On the website the user can make a post and talk about anything on it. It also has an inspirational quote generator that uses an API to fetch data on random quotes | Quinn Eliabeth was an online shopping website. Its frontend was amazing. You could pick pieces of clothing and add them to cart. It adds to your overall price. | Scheduler was a website that allowed you to add events to a calender. It also used an API to fetch weather data. You input a city and it gives you the weather of that city. | . Computer Animation . . Computer animation was a great experience. Stundets created a whole entire 3D virtual wrold. There was donuts, tables, and walls in the one I looked at. It looked as if a cartoon could have been developed from this. | I have already done this class and it is so fun | . Drawing and Painting . . Drawing and painting is not my strong suit. This is why I think it is so much more impressive what some of these studetns are able to accomplish. There were many different great drawings. There were realistics portraits as well as creative chaos. | . What I could do better . Ideas . The Night at the Musuem taught me many things | Making a calender through fastpages | Using a large API to fetch data that only can be accessed through an input. The - API from my project was just a table. It was very basic and I think I can make it more complex. | Quinn Elizibeth taught me that by adding up values of the prices of clothes you can make a final checkout price. I could use this in a different way such as a math system. Maybe a calculator. | Striver showed me that making a social media platform is possible. I could maybe use this as a system to make posts on another website. | . How to get a better grade . Throughout the trimester I thought I could get away with only getting 2.7s every week and end wiht an A. However when I did this it lowered my grade much more than I thought. It meant my grade heavily depended on the final. Now I am in a situation where I might get a B if I didn’t meet the critera of the poject. | I will also make sure to pay more attention in class. I wasn’t paying as much attention as I shoud have during lectures | I need to work harder in class so I don’t have to do my projects on the weekends. | I have to also read more on the scheldule so I can do assignments correctly. | .",

As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language.

An API and a little coding logic will be a big step toward getting meaningful data for a project. There are many API providers, find one that might work for your project to complete this hack. When picking an API you are looking for something that will work with either JavaScript Fetch or Python Request. Here are some samples, these are not qualified in any way. . RapidAPI- GitHub Project | No Key APIs Article | Twitter Developer | Google Developer | Reddit Developer | . Show API and format results in either Web Page or Jupyter Notebook. Ultimately, I will expect that we do APIs in backend (Python/Flask). However, for this Hack you can pick your preference.
