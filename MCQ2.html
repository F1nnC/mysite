<h3 id="question-7">Question 7</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I missread the question and mixed up the foxes and sheep role in the game. The sheep should have been reversed with goats, and foxes with sheep.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="question-8">Question 8</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I selected option A but not option D because I thought the sum of borrows and returns is a odd not postive. Although 1 book has 1 borrow and 1 return equaling a postive number</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="question-17">Question 17</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The D option does the same thing as I did when I clicked option A. The outside result=false, is now inside the if stament, doing the same thing.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="question-27">Question 27</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The rotate_left and rotate_right action had to be done out side of the repeat n times.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Most of my answers were because I didn’t choose all possible peices of code on a multiple choice section, for example I would choose C, but It was suposed to be C and B</li>
  <li>The other answeres I got wrong were because of me doind something wrong in my head, or going to quick</li>
</ul>
