<ol>
  <li>I felt that my standords for grading and collegeboards are starting to become simalar. There was only one missed point that I didn’t get the same as college board and it was because I thought a program was described enough. I pretty much understand all 6 crietra now and what is needed for them.</li>
  <li>My program in it current state has completed, Program and Purpose, Algorithm Impletation, and Testing. The reason for the others not being completed is because we still need to connect it fully to the backend.</li>
  <li>Of the many reason that I’ve seen for a critera not being filled is the Data Abstraction catagory. The way I wont incounter this is by making sure I have to code segments, that mention each other, and are named well.</li>
</ol>
